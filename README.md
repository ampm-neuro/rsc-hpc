# RSC-HPC-LFP
Analysis of behavioral data and electrophysiological data collected simultaneously in RSC and HPC

This is a linear track project with in vivo electrophysiology (single cell and LFP) recorded simultaneously 
in the retrosplenial cortex and hippocampus CA1. The project was abandoned after a similar project was 
published by another group.
